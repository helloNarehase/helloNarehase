Hi, I'm a novice developer with the nickname Narehase.

I like to create my own algorithms and rules through experience, 
and I can write code skilfully.
If you want to see my previous code, you can find me **@Narehase**!

I mostly play around with Python and do fun things with matrices.

Available code and platforms are 

> Android Studio (Kotlin),

> C (C++)

> ""Python"" 

and to some extent derivatives like **.ino** and **Java**.

My development tree looks like this

> AI:
>> ML.py (machine learning) - DNN.py (deep learning) - CNN.py (convolutional neural networks) - RN.py (reinforcement learning neural networks)

> Application : 
>> None ( Virtual Vision : ios <-> Aos Communication App, Notification App)

> Other : 
>> Please give me suggestions (narehasedevel@gmail.com) here!
